Conclusion:

This project focused on analyzing layoff data to provide insights into the layoff trends, the most affected regions, industries, and companies. After cleaning the data and fixing date conversion issues, we explored several key factors, including:

1 .The states and industries most affected by layoffs.
2. Companies with the highest layoffs and the number of workers impacted.
3. The distinction between temporary and permanent layoffs.
4. The influence of unions and the time gap between receiving and enacting layoffs.

This analysis will provide valuable insights to better understand the scope and trends of layoffs across various industries and regions, 
helping stakeholders make informed decisions and plan mitigation strategies.
